# **Human-specific Genes with LncRNA-origin Encode Unique Human Brain Development**

## Introduction

Although gene duplication was considered as the predominant mechanism for the origin of new genes, we and other have proposed that new proteins can also evolve *de novo* from ancestral loci encoding lncRNAs. As mRNAs and lncRNAs show distinct features in subcellular distribution, how this lncRNA-mRNA transition happens remain unclear. Moreover, although the emergence of these new genes are likely driven by neutral forces, they are evolutionarily significant in general, indicating a pre-adaptation origin in which they acquire functions immediately upon achieving their coding potential. How and why this quick, all-or-nothing transition to functionality happens? Finally, the specific biological functions of these theoretically-functional new genes are still to be clarified. Here, we addressed these key issues using human-monkey comparative genomics and verifications in cell lines and human cortical organoids.

- Deep learning part: We used the two two convolutional and pooling layers to investigate the key cis-elements underpinning the nuclear export of transcripts. And we further extracted the key cis-elements differentiating transcripts with varied nuclear export activity by prioritizing the activation values in the first convolutional layer of this CNN model by improving and using the method similar to DeepCpG (https://github.com/PMBio/deepcpg).
