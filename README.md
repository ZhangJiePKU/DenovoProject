# **Human-specific Genes with LncRNA-origin Encode Unique Human Brain Development**

## Introduction

Although gene duplication was considered as the predominant mechanism for the origin of new genes, we and other have proposed that new proteins can also evolve *de novo* from ancestral loci encoding lncRNAs. As mRNAs and lncRNAs show distinct features in subcellular distribution, how this lncRNA-mRNA transition happens remain unclear. Moreover, although the emergence of these new genes are likely driven by neutral forces, they are evolutionarily significant in general, indicating a pre-adaptation origin in which they acquire functions immediately upon achieving their coding potential. How and why this quick, all-or-nothing transition to functionality happens? Finally, the specific biological functions of these theoretically-functional new genes are still to be clarified. Here, we addressed these key issues using human-monkey comparative genomics and verifications in cell lines and human cortical organoids.
